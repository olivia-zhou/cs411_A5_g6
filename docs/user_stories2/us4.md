## 4. "as a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out of spotify to protect my information"

**Happy path:** There should be a simple log out button which, upon being pressed, prompts the user to confirm that they want to log out. If they confirm, they should be logged out. If they cancel, the prompt should go away and they should be back on the same screen as they were prior to selecting the button.

**Description:** The user should be able to log out any time if they want. The access should be simple, easy to find and works in any situations(include no signal, no internet and etc.). If user has log in an unauthorised device, it should erase everything when user log out(include view history, travel path, playlist and etc). When 
user log in an new device, it should ask user that if they want to authorise current device. If spotify is doing nothing or in background mode for thirty mins, it will automatically log out. 

**Exceptions:** Obviously, if the user isn't logged in, they shouldn't be able to log out. So, we won't provide a way to do so until they've logged in.
