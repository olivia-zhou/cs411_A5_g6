## 5. "as a user, I want to be able to view the current weather to know what the weather will be like when traveling"

**Happy Path:** After the user successfully enters the destination in Story 1, the user should be able to access the weather on a widget on our web application. The user should be able to view the weather information of the current location, the destination, and the change during traveling. 

**Exceptions:** One possible scenario is that the trip encounters extreme weather conditions, such as a storm or hurricane. We will pop up a window to alert the user of the current situation, but the user can choose to continue or cancel the trip. If they cancel the trip, the user will return to the main page in Google Maps.

**Description:** The user should be able to view detailed weather information they may experience without logging in. We will include temperature, the chance of rain, humidity, wind, visibility, and air quality press to prepare the user for the trip. Keywords from the weather information such as rain, sunny, and hot will be used for generating playlists in Story 5. 

**Edited:** After the user succecessfully enters the destination, the user should be able to see the weather of the current/origin location on a pop up alert on our web application without logging in. The user should be able to to see one word description of the weather. The more detailed weather information, extreme weather condition notification, and weather information of the destination and the change during traveling were dropped. Keywords from the weather information such as rainy or sunny will be used for generating playlists in Story 5.
