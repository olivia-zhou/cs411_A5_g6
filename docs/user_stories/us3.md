## 3. "as a logged-in user, I want to view the playlist so I can see what music has been recommended to me"

**Happy path:** After clicking generate playlist in Story 6, the app prompts the user to check their Spotify account to view the new playlist, as the playlist is directly dropped into their Spotify account. The user should then be able view all songs in the playlist and listen to the playlist through Spotify.

What the playlist will be named "Weather Playlist" and will have a brief description of our app. The playlist image will be a collage of the first couple of tracks to give the user a preview of the newly created playlist. 

Given that our app is powered by Spotify, which provides music streaming services, it will be convenient for the user if our app enables the user to begin listening to the playlist in just a few clicks. 

**Exceptions:** If the user is not logged in and they try to follow the playlist, they'll be prompted to log into Spotify first. This would be handled as described in story #2.
