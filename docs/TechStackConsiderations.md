# Tech Stack Choices and Reasoning

## Chosen Tech Stack: React/Flask/MongoDB

### Frontend: React
React is a very popular frontend framework, so we'll be able to find resources online if we run into roadblocks. Also, since React is so commonly used, it will be good to gain experience with React now for use in any potential future projects.
	
### Backend: Flask
Some team members have previous experience using Flask as a backend and all team members are proficient in Python, which is used to code in Flask. Flask is also a popular backend framework, so there will be good online resources to aid us. It is also easy to learn and to use.

### Database: MongoDB
Some team members have used MongoDB previously.	

One idea for a use of the database was to cache for each region on Earth its weather information or recommended playlist. MongoDB natively supports geoNear queries, which can help with that.

As to whether we should use a relational or nonrelational database, we do not foresee our data becoming so complex that a relational database would provide significant benefits in computational efficiency over a nonrelational database.

## Alternative Tech Stack 1: React/Django/MongoDB

We ended up not choosing this tech stack.

### Backend: Django
We considered using Django because all team members are proficient in Python. Django is an enticing option for a backend because it is a very featureful framework. We did not have previous experience with Django, but some team members did have experience with Flask. They assured us it would be easy to learn and demonstrated simple API calls using Flask, so we chose Flask over Django.

### Database: MongoDB
