# Tech Stack Choices and Reasoning

## Frontend: React
React is a very popular frontend framework, so we'll be able to find resources online if we run into roadblocks. Also, since React is so commonly used, it will be good to gain experience with React now for use in any potential future projects.
	
## Backend: Flask
Some team members have previous experience using Flask as a backend and all team members are proficient in Python, which is used to code in Flask.

## Database: MongoDB
Some team members have used MongoDB previously.	

One idea for a use of the database was to cache for each region on Earth its weather information or recommended playlist. MongoDB natively supports geoNear queries, which can help with that.

As to whether we should use a relational or nonrelational database, we do not foresee our data becoming so complex that a relational database would provide significant benefits in computational efficiency over a nonrelational database.
