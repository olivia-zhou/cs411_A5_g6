## 7. "As a logged-in user, I want to view a list of previously generated playlists based off of a given destination"

**Happy Path:** Once I've logged in, I want to be able to navigate to a history page (likely through a sidebar). On this page, I should be able to search by destination to get a list of playlists which this app has previously generated for that same destination. I should then be able to view the details of any of these individual playlists.

**Description:** This feature should allow the user to query our database of previously generated playlists for those with some given destination. The results will then be given to the user who can interact with them in a way similar to a newly generated playlist.

**Exceptions:** If no previouly generated playlists are associated with the destination given, the history page should display test clarifying that no playlists were found.
