## 3. "as a logged-in user, I want to view the playlist so I can see what music has been recommended to me"

**Happy path:** After clicking generate playlist in Story 6, the app generate a playlist and display it to the user. The user should then be able view all songs in the playlist and listen to the playlist through Spotify.

What the app displays to the user can be some information about each song like its title and artist. The app can also give a short summary of the playlist like the top few artists within the playlist, the most popular genre of music within the playlist, or a title or short phrase for the playlist.

Given that our app is powered by Spotify, which provides music streaming services, it will be convenient for the user if our app enables the user to begin listening to the playlist in just a few clicks. [Spotify allows developers to embed a playlist directly into a website.](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/embed/) The app can also give a link that leads directly to a Spotify url for that playlist.
