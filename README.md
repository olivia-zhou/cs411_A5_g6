    For windows users: ```py -m venv env```

    For mac/unix users: ```source env/bin/activate```
    For windows users in git bash:  ```. env\Scripts\activate```

2) Run ```bash ./update_reqs.sh``` to get all dependencies and requirements for python and node

3) Run ```bash ./run_backend.sh``` and ```bash ./run_frontend.sh``` in separate terminals to run the frontend and backend simultaneously

- WINDOWS USERS: Don't run the shell scripts from Powershell, use git bash plz
